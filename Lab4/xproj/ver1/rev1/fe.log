The design submitted for place and route did not meet the specified timing
requirements.  Please use the static timing analysis tools (TRCE or Timing
Analyzer) to report which constraints were not met.  To obtain a better result,
you may try the following:
  * Use the Re-entrant routing feature to run more router iterations on the
design.
  * Check the timing constraints to make sure the design is not
over-constrained.
  * Specify a higher placer effort level, if possible.
  * Specify a higher router effort level.
  * Use the Multi-Pass PAR (MPPR) feature.  This generates multiple placement
trials from which the best (i.e., lowest design score) placement can be used
with re-entrant routing to obtain a better result.

Please consult the Development System Reference Guide for more detailed
information about the usage options pertaining to these features.
